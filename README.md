Type, save, and let Android do the talking

This program is intended for folks that can't talk.

You type in text, it saves it.

When you press the text, it says it.

You don't have to pay for it.  You can't prevent others from getting the source.

You may have to set the checkbox for installing not from the store. (Locally)
